# COWINBot

Place your token in the Client.Run line, and you should be good to go. 

There are 2 commands, one to find a vaccine for a specific date, and one to find a vaccine over a range of dates(2-6 days).

First Command: .searchforvaccines (PINCODE) (AGE) (Number of Days)
For E.G you would type .searchforvaccines 500010 45 2 and would get an output from the bot.

Second Command: .findvaccine (PINCODE) (DATE)
For E.G you would type .findvaccine 500010 23-3-21
